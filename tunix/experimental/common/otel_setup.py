"""Process-level OpenTelemetry metrics setup for the experimental runtime.

``tunix.sft.metrics_logger.MetricsLogger`` double-writes every logged scalar as
an OpenTelemetry gauge once ``MetricsLoggerOptions.enable_opentelemetry`` is
set, but it deliberately does not own the provider: with nothing installed the
API resolves a proxy provider that silently drops every measurement. Each
process that wants to export therefore installs a global ``MeterProvider`` --
an OTLP/gRPC exporter behind a periodic reader, with a ``service.name``
resource so the collector and backend can tell the orchestrator, trainer and
rollout streams apart.

Configuration is environment-driven so the launchers can enable it per
process without code changes:

* ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` -- enables export when set (for example
  ``http://localhost:4317``; every jobset template runs with
  ``hostNetwork: true``, so a node-local collector is reachable there from a
  pod and from ``launcher.sh`` alike). Unset leaves the default backends only.
* ``OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`` -- overrides the per-process default service name.
* ``OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL`` -- export interval in milliseconds (default
  10000). Measurements are batched in memory until exported, so a shorter
  interval narrows what a crashing process can lose; ``shutdown`` is also
  registered at exit to drain the last batch.
