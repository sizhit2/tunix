  """Manages weight synchronization over Raiden for sampler adapters.

  The destination side of a weight sync round: bind_weight_sync binds the
  sampler's transformer state to the raiden transport, the transfer lands
  in host staging, and weight_sync installs it on device.

  Caveat: the transport binds the live transformer state directly, so
  weight_sync writes into the serving copy rather than a shadow buffer.
  Serving is protected by the manager's closed-admission window, but an
  abort after a partial weight_sync cannot restore the previous weights.
